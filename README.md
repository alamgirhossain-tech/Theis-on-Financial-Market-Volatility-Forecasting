The thesis examined the forecast performance of the several stocks index with various GARCH models, VaR, and trading analysis. The study examines the Realized volatility index relative to the GARCH family of models in forecasting volatility for the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industry Average and Nasdaq 100.The research examined the forecasting volatility after Covid-19 and try to find the best model of the GARCH-type model. This investigation also usages GARCH, E-GARCH, GJR-GARCH, I-GARCH, APARCH, and FI-GARCH models to forecast volatility and stock index performance. To investigate the in-sample information content as well as the conditional variance equations of the GARCH family of models are enhanced with the realized volatility indices from Oxford Realized library. However, to appraise the out-of-sample forecasts, we generate one-day ahead GARCH rolling forecasts and apply the Value-at-Risk with 1% and 5% confidence interval. The comparative performance has been evaluated based on MSE, RMSE, and MAE. Furthermore, a statistical significance test was conducted to evaluate the data from each stock index. The empirical findings of the research shows mixed evaluation when selecting the best model in terms of accuracy and forecast. The experiment also shown there was a significant impact of volatility clustering and conditional variance due to the spread of Covid-19.
